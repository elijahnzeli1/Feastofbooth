                        <p>
                            Pastor Steve Turungah is the Senior Pastor at Deliverance Church Machakos. He oversees two sanctuaries; City of Prayer and Mount Zion. He is an astute teacher of God's word, an ardent lover of Christ and people.</p>
                        <p>The mandate was birthed after years of intense study into past revivals and awakenings in the world. This study prompted a sustained prayer to see a move of God break out in line with the book of Habakkuk 3:2. In
                            2018 the LORD put in his heart that the much-anticipated revival would be realized in our time.</p>
                        <p>His endeavor is to see a coming together of the body of Christ for one purpose; petitioning heaven to invade the earth; that the legacy of the move of God and His reality will be bequeathed to coming generations as an inheritance and that our towns will live to their prophetic destinies.

                                            Machakos has the potential to become great as it previously
                                            almost did; that potential only needs to be harnessed with intentionality. The county government,
                                            Non-Governmental Organizations, churches and Machakos residents will all have to join hands
                                            and play their part in bringing back the glory due to Machakos.

                                            Together we can put Machakos back on the map of this country by leveraging on the gift of devolution and championing for
                                            divine intervention until this town becomes a benchmark and a reference point for religion, trade,
                                            media, agriculture, education, health, politics, real estate etc. Zechariah 1:17

                            <br>
                            i. Feast of Passover Leviticus 23:4-8 – represents the cross as a way of escape from the damnation that awaits those who don’t appropriate the blood of Jesus into their lives.  Exodus 12:6
                            <br>
                            ii. Feast of unleavened bread Leviticus 23:6 – represents Jesus’ sinless life and the only perfect sacrifice for our sins.
                            <br>
                            iii. Feast of first fruits Leviticus 23:10 – Paul refers to Jesus as the first fruits of the dead in 1st Corinthians 15:20. This feast was celebrated on the third day of the Passover weekend which was the 16th day of the month of Nisan.
                            <br>
                            iv. Feast of weeks Leviticus 23:16 – To the New Testament believer this represents Pentecost. It used to be observed seven weeks after the feast of first fruits.
                            <br>
                            v. The feast of trumpets Leviticus 23:24 – These points us to the rapture. Symbolizing time for the children of God to go and rest.
                            <br>
                            vi. Day of atonement Leviticus 23:26 – This feast by revelation communicated the cleansing of our sins by Christ and the resultant at-one-ment of man with God.
                            <br>
                            vii. Feast of booths or feast of tabernacles Leviticus 23:34 – This reveals a time when the children of Israel would dwell in temporary booths to commemorate Gods provision and protection during their forty-year journey through the wilderness. God was symbolically telling us that a day would come when we now dwell in a permanent tent after our journey on earth is done. Hence it symbolized the eventual gathering together of the body of Christ.

                        <p>Machakos the Sleeping Giant.Machakos derives her name from Masaku who was a descendant of the famous long-distance
                            trader known as Kivoi. History has this to say about Masaku:</p>
                        <p>He was a political leader, a medicine man, and a prophet. He was able to predict if his people were about to be attacked.
                            This made him prepare his army well in order to defeat the enemy. He predicted the coming of the Europeans and the building of the railway.
                            His home was near where the present Machakos town now stands.
                            The town and the district were named after him ‘Masaku’s place’ hence, Machakos. When the whites came into Kenya in the 1880’s, the following advantages became of Machakos: - </p>

                                                    Machakos was established as a colonial administrative capital in 1887.
                                                    The capital was later moved to Nairobi in 1899 when Machakos was by-passed during the construction of the Kenya-Uganda Railway.

                                                    The town served as an economic, administrative and satellite center before and during the colonial period for the actualization of colonial governance in the Kenyan protectorate. This included the control of the hinterland of Kenyan colony up to 1907.
                                                    In essence, Machakos is the oldest administrative municipality in East and Central Africa.

                                    Bishop Paul Mutua is a founding father of RGC; a charismatic church which was started in 1974 in the Mathare slums in Nairobi by Bishop Arthur Kitonga who sought asylum from Uganda where he was serving as a pastor of the Anglican Church during the brutal regime of Idi Amin Dada. Their preaching method targeted students in schools to teach them the faith so that they would share their faith after school. This preaching method helped to spread the RGC which is now established throughout Kenya and can currently be found in most of Africa. The RGC draws its teachings from the Bible and emphasizes the principle of sola scriptura (the Bible as its own interpreter). The church has had an impact on society through its inclusion of women in ministry, its special programs for the poor, the widows and orphans, and other marginalized groups.
                                    Bishop Mutua today remains a father to many, an icon, a man of integrity in the Kenyan church history. Bishop Mutua does not confine himself within the denominational borders; his ministry has transcended beyond denominational confines and has generated indelible impact to the wider body of Christ. He has kept the faith. He is a man that God has used mightily to change thousands of lives. He is a man of integrity, humility, honesty and insightfulness.
                                    His biography is captured in detail in his amazing book - Leadership from Eden to eternity.
